# Rain prediction in Australia based on weather data set in Australia

This project is aimed at training machine learning models on weather data sets to make rain predictions in Australia.

## Dataset

Folder kaggle/input contains all the weather datasets in Australia including training and test datasets. 

Folder kaggle/output contains the file including the predictions of rain in Australia on the test dataset.

The dataset I chose to train is taken from Kaggle.
